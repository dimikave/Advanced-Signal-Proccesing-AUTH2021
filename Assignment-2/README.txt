- lagwind.m , toep.m and bisp3cum.m are functions related to each other
  so bisp3cum.m can estimate the bispectrum and the third order cumulant
- bispeciV2.m is a copy of bispeci.m function of HOSA Toolbox, with window
  deactivated
- Main_2.m is the file that produces the plots and the estimations
  for the exersice
- bspecPlotInfo.m, bspecPlotInfo2 are programs to run
  some additional plot information according to the area we want
Note: It is taken for granted that people with access to this files have
      HOSA Toolbox for Matlab in their devices added to their PATH.
