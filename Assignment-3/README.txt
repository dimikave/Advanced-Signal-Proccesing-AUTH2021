Validity Check of Giannakis' Formula

- bisp3cum.m , toep.m, lagwind.m used to estimate cumulants

- bisp3cumV2.m is a modified version of bisp3cum.m with deactivated plots for
  speed purposes

- plotDif.m creates 2 plots: original and estimated signal

- X.m is the file that creates the 
  X.mat (data) -> x : output, v: input, vn: centered input, b : coefficients

- X.mat is the data file saved from the generation while running X.m

- x_v_sigs.m creates and returns the assigned x,v for the needs of step 8

- nrmse.m calculates the Normalized Root Mean Square Error

- GiannakisFormula.m returns the estimated impulse response for input q

- Main_3.m is the main program for the exercise
